## Poems for your soul
Children love repetitions and rhymes and have a lot of fun playing with the language themselves: twisting letters and words, forming (nonsensical) rhymes and creating new words. We feature a fine selection on children's poems that bring language to life, arouse the joy of poetry and inspire imagination.
