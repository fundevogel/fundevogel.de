## Thorough selection
Every year in spring and autumn we collect a selection of (short: new releases desc: In Germany, there are almost 10,000 every year!) in a list of recommendations.

Here you can find all previous editions at a glance - and who knows, maybe there's one or another buried reading treasure to find!

Info:
- Each issue is **divided into reading ages**, from toddlers to first readers to young adults.
- In addition, we sort new books **according to categories**, that is picture books, books to read aloud, audiobooks and non-fiction.
- In spring there is fresh reading food for **Easter**, in autumn for **Christmas** and great **calendars** with motifs from children's and youth literature for the next year.
- New: In the autumn edition 2020 you will also find **Graphic Novels** and **Creative Handicrafts**!
