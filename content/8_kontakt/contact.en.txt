## Your way to us
Our bookshop is located on the idyllic Marienstraße in Freiburg's picturesque southern Old Town, within the pedestrian zone, in a comfortable neighbourhood whose very own magic invites indigenous people and tourists alike to indulge – come and see for yourselves!

----

Bike: The Fundevogel bookstore is only two minutes afoot from central Augustinerplatz. From there you go past the famous Feierling Brewery, turn right and cross the bridge spanning the Gewerbebach (beware of the crocodile). Following the street you can see our book store on the left, opposite to the (link: http://www.freiburg.de/pb/,Len/237848.html text: Museum für Neue Kunst target: blank).

----

Car: You can also reach our book store by car via Wallstraße, turning into Marienstraße, although you are only allowed to halt for quick loading and unloading. For parking, check out the parking garages Schlossberg and Schwabentor (within five minutes walking distance).

----

Tram: Or you just take the tram - the nearest tram stops are "Bertoldsbrunnen", "Holzmarkt" (multiple tramlines) and "Oberlinden" (tramline 1).
